The purpose of SORA is for all team members to be registered in a united and
harmonious system that keeps track of everything related to the team, including
competition results, individual and team statistics, practice questions and
other resources, a comprehensive calendar, recent news, and meeting attendance.
Using such a system will thoroughly facilitate team organization and communication.

the MySQL database management system and a web server. Its code is managed in a
